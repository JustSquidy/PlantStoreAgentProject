# Return & Refund Policy

We are committed to delivering healthy, thriving plants to our customers. Please review the following terms carefully before placing your order.

## Return Eligibility

Returns are accepted only if the plant arrives dead, severely damaged, or not as described (wrong species or size).

Minor cosmetic imperfections, such as slight leaf blemishes, soil displacement, or minor leaf yellowing, do not qualify for a return.

Plants damaged during transit due to carrier mishandling may qualify if documented appropriately.

## Return Request Window

All return requests must be submitted within 3 calendar days of receiving your shipment.

Requests made after this period will not be accepted.

## Winter & Seasonal Shipping Disclaimer

During winter months, customers may choose to add a heat pack to their order for an additional fee.

If you decline this option, we cannot be held responsible for plant damage or death caused by cold temperatures during transit.

Extreme weather conditions (e.g., heatwaves, storms) may affect plant arrival; we will make reasonable efforts to mitigate risk but cannot guarantee delivery under such conditions.

## Live Arrival Guarantee

We guarantee that your plants will arrive alive and in good condition at the time of delivery. If your plant arrives dead or severely damaged, please provide:

* Clear photographs of the plant, including any damage and the original packaging.

* Your order number and a brief description of the issue.

* Any additional relevant information, such as shipping delay or incorrect item received.

This information must be submitted within the 3-day return window.

## Refunds

Approved claims will receive a refund for the plant cost or store credit.

Shipping fees and optional heat packs are non-refundable.

If an incorrect item is shipped, we will cover the return shipping cost and issue a refund for the product.

## Non-Returnable Situations

* Plants that have been repotted, trimmed, or otherwise altered after delivery.

* Damage due to neglect, improper care, or pest infestation after arrival.

* Orders where the heat pack was declined during winter and the plant died due to cold exposure.

* Allergic reactions or sensitivity to plants.

## How to Submit a Claim

Email us at dont@email.this within 3 days of delivery.

Include your order number, photos, and a description of the issue.

Once approved, we will provide instructions for returning the plant or issuing a refund.

## Additional Considerations

Delayed shipments due to carrier issues or customs are generally not eligible for return unless the plant arrives dead or severely damaged.

We reserve the right to request additional documentation for verification, such as a short video showing the plant’s condition on arrival.
